Google homepage exercise for Microverse

In this project I will create a google homepage from scratch.

This exercise is part of the pre-course-work at wwww.microverse.org and it was made with this tutorial from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
